// M71: what an overlay gets from the hub (docs/plans/hub-overlays.md, decision 3): the daemon
// port, the theme, and a few verbs; it no longer holds the view. Its own file, not the port's:
// the port is the daemon's, the host is the view's. The overlays in hub/overlays/ are built on
// it, each with its slice of the port (M72–M74; phase 1 keeps the log and usage).
